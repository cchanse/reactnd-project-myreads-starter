# MyReads Project

This MyReads Project was the first project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books that they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. Udacity provided the API server and client library tht was used to persist information as the user interacts with the app.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MyReads app:

* Clone this git repo
* Run `npm install` to install all project dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the development server
